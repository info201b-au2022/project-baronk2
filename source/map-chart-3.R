But the most obvious statistic is that India has had more than 30,000,000 child deaths for children under five years old in that time span. Certain land areas shown in gray either have no data (Antarctica), or are territories of other countries that do have data (Greenland, considered part of Denmark, and French Guiana, considered a part of France). The horizontal bars and lines across the top appear to be ggplot artifacts of Alaska's and Russia's being displayed on either end of the map. Please ignore them, as they are insignificant to the map's data."
