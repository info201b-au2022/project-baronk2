```{r setup, include=FALSE}

knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../source/aggregated_table.R")

## Aggregated Table

```{r table, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
  knitr::kable(aggregated_table, format="html")
```



## Dynamic Paragraph

```{r, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}

most_recent_leading_cause <-  get_most_recent_leading_cause()

most_recent_leading_cause_total_deaths  <-  get_most_recent_leading_cause_total_deaths()

most_recent_trailing_cause <- get_most_recent_trailing_cause()

most_recent_trailing_cause_total_deaths <-  get_most_recent_trailing_cause_total_deaths()

most_recent_leading_cause_leading_country <-  get_most_recent_leading_cause_leading_country()

most_recent_leading_cause_leading_country_deaths <-  get_most_recent_leading_cause_leading_country_deaths()

```

The most recently recorded leading cause of death for children 0-4 years old is
`r most_recent_leading_cause`, resulting in `r prettyNum(most_recent_leading_cause_total_deaths, big.mark = ",")` deaths. On the other hand, the disease causing the least number of deaths is `r most_recent_trailing_cause` with `r prettyNum(most_recent_trailing_cause_total_deaths, big.mark = ",")` child deaths. When looking at `r most_recent_leading_cause`, the country leading this death toll is `r most_recent_leading_cause_leading_country` with a numerical value of `r prettyNum(most_recent_leading_cause_leading_country_deaths, big.mark = ",")`.



## Chart 1

Here is a bar chart showcasing the correlation between the 13 causes of infant deaths and number of deaths in 2017.


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p <- get_bar_chart()
p
```

Chart 1, represents the 13 different diseases that lead the world in deaths within children ages 0-4. Having this chart gives a visualization of how  big of an impact each disease has had on the death toll. The diseases can be seen on the x-axis, whereas, the number of deaths can be seen on the y-axis. Having a bar chart allows viewers to easily identify which disease has made the most impact on child mortality. 

## Chart 2

Here is a pi chart showcasing the amount of deaths for each of the 13 causes in 2017.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("https://raw.github.com/info201b-au2022/project-baronk2/main/source/chart_2.R")

  ggplot(deaths_in_test, aes(x="", y=deaths, fill=cause)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1, color="black") +
    coord_polar("y", start=0) +

    theme_void()

```

This chart is important as it shows the viewer how much of an impact different causes have had on child mortality from 2000 to 2017. It gives an easy visual representation of how much of the whole a certain cause makes up, letting viewers know with a glance which causes are more pressing than others.


## Chart 3

Here is a map showing where there have been the most child deaths globally from
2000 to 2017.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
get_deaths_map()
deaths_map_paragraph <- get_deaths_map_paragraph()
```

`r deaths_map_paragraph`
