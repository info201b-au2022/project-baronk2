## What is this file for?

* This file will eventually become your project report for **P02: Exploratory Data Analysis**. Specifically, you will write rmarkdown to report your exploratory data analysis.

* Please see Canvas for more details.

## ACCESSING THE /source DIRECTORY
### Example 1: Source some code and run a function
```{r}
# Example 1: Note relative path, which can be read: Up one
# directory(..), down into source (/source), and 
# then "source" an R file (data_access.R)
source("../source/data_access.R")
data_access_test()
```

### Example 2: Initialize a variable and then use it
```{r}
# Example 1: This function was "sourced" above
msg <- data_access_test(" Morgan!")
```

> `r msg` Hope you have a good day!! 

## ABOUT THIS FILE: 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Dynamic Paragraph

```
Most recently recorded leading cause of death for children 0-4 years old is Acute lower respiratory infection, resulting in 22,972,323 deaths. On the other hand, the disease causing the least number of deaths is Meningitis with 4,185,463 infant deaths. When looking at Acute lower respiratory infection, the country leading this death toll is India with a numerical value of 141,970. Fortunately, there were countries such as Andorra, Cook Islands, Cyprus, and San Marino with zero deaths. When further looking into Meningitis the least threating disease, the country with the highest death toll was Nigeria with 25397 deaths. 
```
## Chart 2

Here is a pi chart showcasing the amount of deaths for each of the 13 causes in 2017.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
source("../source/chart_2.R")

 ggplot(deaths_in_2017, aes(x="", y=deaths, fill=cause)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", width=1, color="black") +
  coord_polar("y", start=0) +
  
  theme_void()

```

## Chart 3

Here is a bar chart showcasing the correlation between the 13 causes of infant deaths and number of deaths in 2017.
